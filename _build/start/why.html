                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Why MyHDL? Here is a good reason: MyHDL is open-source software that you can
use for free.  However, there are many other good reasons why MyHDL is worth
considering.  This page describes a number of common situations and opinions,
and how MyHDL addresses them. If you recognize them, MyHDL may be a good
solution for you.</p>
<h2 id="new-to-digital-hardware-design">New to digital hardware design</h2>
<p>Let's be honest about it: there's a lot to learn and it will be hard work.
However, choosing the right development language can make the task
significantly easier. Python is one of the easiest programming languages to
learn, and MyHDL aims to achieve the same for hardware design.</p>
<p>Moreover, with MyHDL you can convert your designs automatically to both Verilog
and VHDL. So you keep all your options open.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-language-power">Dynamic language power</h2>
<p>If you're a practicing hardware designer, you're probably using dynamic
languages (sometimes called "scripting" languages) in your workflow already.
For example, tcl is popular for tool control.  Also, many designers use perl to
glue things together. Others use ruby or Python for that purpose.</p>
<p>It is clear that these high-level dynamic languages play an essential role in
modern digital design. Verilog or VHDL alone is not enough. Many designers even
prefer those languages over their HDL, because they can get things done quickly
with them.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if one could use such a language directly to design
hardware?  That's exactly what MyHDL offers.</p>
<h2 id="modern-software-techniques">Modern software techniques</h2>
<p>In the software methodology world, a lot of innovation is going on, with
buzzwords such as "agile", "rapid application development", "scrum", and
"test-driven development".  This is not just hype. The new ideas and techniques
offer real improvements to the development processes. Naturally, they are
emerging in the communities of modern software languages, such as Python.</p>
<p>As HDL-based design has many similarities with software development, the new
ideas are potentially quite relevant. Nevertheless, the hardware design world
seems detached from them. </p>
<p>By using MyHDL, the newest software development techniques are readily
available to the hardware designer, thanks to its Python foundation.  For
example, you can use a Python unit test framework to do test-driven development
for hardware design.</p>
<h2 id="algorithm-and-implementation-unified">Algorithm and implementation unified</h2>
<p>Python is an ideal language for algorithm development and many engineers use it
for this purpose.  Commonly this work and a subsequent HDL implementation are
done by different engineers.  They use a different set of tools that require a
specialized level of knowledge.</p>
<p>MyHDL is a big step towards the unification of the two domains.  With
Python/MyHDL an algorithm or model designer can explore HDL implementation and
an HDL designer can explore algorithm and model design, all within the same
environment.  Of course, the conversion from algorithm to an HDL implementation
still requires knowledge of HDL-based design. But being able to do this while
staying in the powerful Python environment can be a significant boost to
quality and productivity.  For example, the verification work can directly be
reused between both design domains.</p>
<h2 id="target-both-verilog-and-vhdl">Target both Verilog and VHDL</h2>
<p>The usage of Verilog versus VHDL differs significantly between regions and
sectors.  However, there is every indication that the overall ratio is about
fifty-fifty, and will remain so in the forseeable future. Consequently, it is
often desirable that a design be available in the "other" language also. For IP
developers, this may even be an explicit design goal.</p>
<p>Using MyHDL is a solution. A MyHDL design can be automatically converted to
equivalent code in both Verilog and VHDL.  Actually, using MyHDL and conversion
is probably the best solution available for language-neutral design. It is
obviously superior to manual conversion. Moreover, direct convertors between
Verilog and VHDL don't work very well. Using a syntactically simple language
like Python as the starting point is an easier way to a create a high-quality
conversion tool.</p>
<h2 id="explicit-but-not-verbose">Explicit, but not verbose</h2>
<p>VHDL has many virtues, but conciseness is not one of them. Many feel that the
syntax is verbose and even redundant, and even experts need a manual nearby to
get the syntax right.</p>
<p>Python is different. It is concise. One reason is that it is a dynamic language
without declarations. But the major reason is its well thought out design.
Moreover, it achieves this without resorting to "magic".  The code remains
explicit, but the syntax has been reduced to the essence. Python has been
called executable pseudocode, and that's actually a quite accurate description.</p>
<h2 id="power-not-complexity">Power, not complexity</h2>
<p>SystemVerilog has been called a "dumping ground" for any feature ever dreamed
up by an EDA company. Through the process of "donations", the language contains
an ever increasing pile of builtin constructs and features. Of course, not all
of them can be equally important or well designed. The experience can be
overwhelming.</p>
<p>One might think that language complexity is a necessary consequence of feature
complexity. However, a language like Python shows that this is not true.  The
core Python language is actually very small. However, it is designed for
extensibility and modularity. Most of the action happens in libraries, with the
core language serving as a common ground. There is an extensive standard
library that comes with the distribution. In addition, there is a vast amount
of third-party libraries available for all kinds of functionality. MyHDL is an
example.</p>
<p>Python's modular structure explicitly separates the essential from the
secondary.  After learning the small core language, you only need to study and
import those libraries that contain the functionality that you need.  This is a
superior and scalable way of dealing with complexity.</p>
<h2 id="signals-and-variables-like-vhdl">Signals and variables, like VHDL</h2>
<p>One of the most confusing aspects of Verilog is about the difference between
blocking and non-blocking assignments.  Actually, if you are <em>not</em> confused
about this, you probably don't have enough experience :-).</p>
<p>Here is the problem. The semantics of blocking (<code>=</code>) versus non-blocking (<code>&lt;=)</code>
assignments are radically different. So different in fact that a language like
VHDL (and MyHDL) uses dedicated objects called signals to implement
non-blocking semantics. However, in Verilog, you can use and mix the two types
of assignments on any object.</p>
<p>In many cases, Verilog's permissiveness on this matter is senseless and
confusing.  Consequently, most designers follow guidelines on acceptable use
patterns. Unfortunately, as a testimony to the initial confusion, such
guidelines can be overly restrictive.  For example, a commonly used guideline
basically forbids variable semantics in clocked synthesizable processes
completely!</p>
<p>MyHDL follows the sensible example of VHDL. It has dedicated signal objects and
signal assignments that correspond to the semantics of Verilog non-blocking
assignments. The clear separation between signals and variables avoids the
confusion about the two types of assignment.</p>
<h2 id="signal-assignments-done-right">Signal assignments done right</h2>
<p>Hardware Description Languages need a way to describe racefree communication
between parallel hardware blocks. This is the purpose of VHDL signal
assignments and Verilog non-blocking assignments. In both languages, these
assignments are implemented using a special assignment symbol, which happens to
be identical: <code>&lt;=</code>.  We will refer to "signal assignments" in the following
discussion.</p>
<p>As signal assignments are not natively present in software languages, HDL
newcomers often have problems with them. While this is a normal part of the
learning process, the VHDL and Verilog approach doesn't help.  Consider the
following pseudocode snippet of signals assignments:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>a &lt;= b
b &lt;= a
</pre></div>


<p>Even when this code is inside procedural code, the semantics are concurrent. In
particular, the value of <code>a</code> used on the second line is <em>not</em> the one assigned
to <code>a</code> on the first. The value used is the current value, while the value
assigned is the future value of <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>MyHDL uses a different approach. Instead of a special assignment symbol for
signals, it uses attribute assignment to the special attribute <code>next</code>.
Attribute assignment is common in object-oriented languages.  Our example
becomes:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>a.next = b
b.next = a
</pre></div>


<p>In this way, it is explicitly clear that the assigment on the first line isn't
modifying the current value, but the next value of the signal.</p>
<p>A MyHDL designer merely has to learn that a signal's future value should be
modified by assigning to its <code>next</code> attribute. From there on, the semantics are
clear from the code.</p>
<h2 id="straighforward-integer-arithmetic">Straighforward integer arithmetic</h2>
<p>When writing synthesizable VHDL code, you typically use the signed and unsigned
types for arithmetic operations. These are "representational" types that focus
on bit representation and bit width. The operators defined for such types have
stringent requirements on the types and bit widths of operands and results.  As
a result, you typically need a lot of conversion functions and resizings.  Many
designers take this for granted and view it as a result of VHDL's strong
typing. In reality, it is a consequence of using low-level types.</p>
<p>MyHDL follows a different path, but one that has actually been shown by VHDL in
the first place. It has the <code>intbv</code> type, which is an integer-like type whose
values can be constrained like in VHDL. However, unlike VHDL, there are no
artificial limits on the minimum and maximum values it can take.  Moreover, and
again unlike VHDL, the type has an indexing and slicing interface to access the
representation if required.</p>
<p>The result is that in synthesizable MyHDL, you can basically do arithmetic
using integers. Therefore, all issues with signed/unsigned representations
simply disappear.  The convertor to VHDL infers the required conversions and
resizings automatically, thereby automating a cumbersome task.</p>
<h2 id="signed-arithmetic-that-works">Signed arithmetic that works</h2>
<p>Signed arithmetic in Verilog can be quite confusing. The reason is that when
you mix signed and unsigned operands, the operation is done in unsigned mode.
This is the opposite of what should be done to get the normally expected
results. To avoid this, operands should be explicitly cast to signed.</p>
<p>In MyHDL, these issues do not exist, because you can basically use integers for
arithmetic, using the <code>intbv</code> type presented in the previous section.  The
convertor to Verilog infers the required casts and bit extensions
automatically.</p>
